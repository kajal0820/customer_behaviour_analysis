## 🪜 Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Loading (Python)**

* Loaded the dataset using **Pandas**.
* Checked data structure, column types, and missing values.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Explored distributions, correlations, and customer segments.
* Visualized purchase trends by **age, category, and gender** using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
* Identified key behavioral patterns and outliers.

### 3. **Data Cleaning**

* Removed nulls, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
* Standardized column names and categorical values.
* Prepared the cleaned dataset for SQL and Power BI integration.

### 4. **SQL Analysis**

* Imported cleaned data into **MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server**.
* Executed analytical SQL queries such as:

  * Top-spending customers
  * Most popular product categories
  * Monthly/seasonal purchase trends
  * Correlation between review ratings and purchase amounts
* Used **GROUP BY**, **JOIN**, **CASE**, and **CTE** queries for deep insights.

### 5. **Power BI Dashboard**

* Connected the cleaned dataset to Power BI.
* Built an **interactive dashboard** including:

  * Total revenue, average order value, and purchase frequency
  * Category-wise and gender-wise spending patterns
  * Time-series analysis for sales performance
  * Filter and slicer options for dynamic insights

### 6. **Report & Presentation (Gamma)**

* Created a summary report showcasing insights and recommendations.
* Designed a **Gamma presentation** with visuals from Power BI and key takeaways for business stakeholders.
